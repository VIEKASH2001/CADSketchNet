We introduce the CADSketchNet dataset, an annotated collection of sketches of 3D CAD models.
- Dataset-A has 58,696 computer-generated sketches of the 3D CAD models across 68 categories of [MCB](https://mechanical-components.herokuapp.com/)
- Dataset-B has 801 hand-drawn sketches of the 3D CAD models across 42 categories of [ESB](https://engineering.purdue.edu/cdesign/wp/downloads/)
